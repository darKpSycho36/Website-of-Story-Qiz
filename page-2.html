                    <h2><b>Story: The Magical Forest</b></h2>
                    <p><pre>      Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a magical forest.
     The forest was filled with tall, ancient trees that seemed to touch the sky.
     The air was always filled with the sweet scent of wildflowers, and the ground was
covered in a soft, mossy carpet...!
    
    In this forest lived a curious little rabbit named Oliver.
    Oliver loved to explore and discover new things. One sunny morning,
       while hopping around, he stumbled upon a mysterious glowing object half-buried in the ground.
    It was a beautiful, sparkling gem that seemed to radiate light.
                        
        Oliver picked up the gem and suddenly felt a strange tingling sensation.
    The forest around him began to shimmer and change. The trees seemed to come to life,
and the flowers danced in a magical rhythm.</pre></p>
